                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p id="aboutintro">Hello and welcome to Stage Confessions!</p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">Stage Confessions is a website that stemmed from a girl’s love for music. It not only aims to share music, but also to give new artists the recognition their musical talent deserves. Here you can find “Stage Confessions Radio” (a playlist that is updated weekly), news on the latest festival lineups and tours, some sick photos taken at shows, discussions on new albums and much more. Hopefully you’ll discover some new music here and fall in love with it just as I have.</p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">What makes Stage Confessions’ mission different from those of other music journalists/bloggers is that here, we intend to create a positive community of music lovers by being respectful towards the musicians we write about and their artwork. For example, you may notice that albums discussed on here are never given rankings; it’s kind of pointless to considering that everyone is going to have different opinions of the work. Instead, we prefer to focus on the messages/lyrics behind the albums, give descriptions of the sounds, and what kinds of emotions they may evoke; but it’s really up to the listener to interpret the music. In addition, we strive to bring lots of diversity by featuring many artists of different races and building an inclusive space.</p>

                    <p class="aboutparagraph">  The editor in chief. She’s a 16 year old Latina living in Los Angeles who spends her time baking desserts, writing, playing her guitar (even though she sucks at it), and dancing at concerts.

Some of her favorite artists include Cuco, Kali Uchis, Mac DeMarco and Tyler, The Creator. You can probably find her in Silver Lake eating ice cream or jamming out at some local L.A. venue.</p>
